# word-guess-game

I built a hangman-style word guessing game that has a '90s television show theme. As someone who still loves watching re-runs of those shows, I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to relect that. I built this using simple JavaScript methods, such as event listeners and conditional statements.

<h3>Languages Used to Build Game:</h3>
<ul><li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>Javascript</li></ul>

<h3>Challenges During my Initial Commit:</h3>
<ul><li>Letters wouldn't print onto the screen, either in the blanks or in the guessed letters.</li>
  <li>The number of wins and losses also wouldn't print onto the screen.</li></ul>
  
<h3>Tentative Issues to Fix:</h3> 
<ul><li>You can select the same incorrect letter more than once, and it'll still repeatedly count as an attempt.</li>
  <li>My images aren't displaying once a user guesses the correct answer.</li></ul>

<h3>Resources:</h3>
I don't own the images; images are from <a href="https://giphy.com">Giphy</a>. I saved them into a folder because I wasn't able to get them displayed by referencing the URL.
