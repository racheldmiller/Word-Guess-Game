# word-guess-game

I built a hangman-style word guessing game that has a '90s television show theme. As someone who still loves watching re-runs of those shows, I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to relect that. I built this using simple JavaScript methods, such as event listeners and conditional statements.

<h3>Languages Used to Build Game:</h3>
<ul><li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>Javascript</li></ul>

<h3>Challenges During my Initial Commit:</h3>
<ul><li>Letters wouldn't print onto the screen, either in the blanks or in the guessed letters.</li>
  <li>The number of wins and losses also wouldn't print onto the screen.</li></ul>
  
<h3>Tentative Issues to Fix:</h3> 
<ul><li>You can select the same incorrect letter more than once, and it'll still repeatedly count as an attempt. 
<li>Pressing a key that's not a letter will print blank under the guessed letters; it'll also count as an attempt.</li>
  <li>Need to add a giphy div, so the gifs show up once the answer is revealed.</ul>
